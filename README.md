# Fixed Income Trading Volumes
## Analyzing trade volumes and forecasting future volumes with time series analysis.

The settlement of these securities generates fees and is therefore correlated to the activity in these respective markets.  The ability to forecast these volumes and indirectly the fee revenue generated can provide helpful forecasting insights.
